# Deep Learning Mini Projects
This repositories contains the project files for the "Deep Learning 2019" mini projects.

# General Decription
All of the codes has been implemented in [PyTorch 1.0.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). If you are using newer version, please make sure for the compatibility of the codes.

# Mini Project 1: Different Arcitechtures in Image Classification
Image classification is a very common task in the field of Computer Vision. In this project the objective is to see how different architectures behave in comparing two digits represented as 14x14 images.
Several techniques can be used to carry out this task and among these. We have tried three different approaches to solve this problem, including direct comparison with/without auxiliary loss, and direct digit classification using a combination fully connected and convolutional layers. 
More information can be found in the report: [Mini Project 1: Description]() . The source code can be found in the `Proj1` directory. For running the project use `test.py` source file.
